This is currently a blockchain simulation I am writing in python. 

I wanted to understand how blockchain works, so I have all the basic implementation of blockchain down. 

Currently, I am using sqllite in order to store the blockchain so that way it can be more like a program that 
a user can use instead of just starting up from scratch each time. 

I also plan to do the following: 
1. Making a test file (after sql is implemented)
2. Create the process of signing transactions and letting the user have a public/private for their wallet
2. Make a full scaled website implemented with django/flask
